# NeuralStyleTransfer

Neural Style Transfer is a concept of transferring a style of an image to a target image. This helps to change the target image to a new style that is adapted from the style image. In the repo, you can see there are 6 different images being generated for every 1000 epochs and with every epoch, the transfer is slowly adapted to the original image(target image).

Style transfer is an interesting augmentation technique. It is somewhat similar to a color transformation, but, it separates itself with the ability to transfer textures and other miscellaneous distortions that are impossible with classic color filters or affine transformations.

By far the main area where NST(Neural Style Transfer) can make an impact is in photo editing; in fact, it already has. A mobile app called Prisma applies ‘filters’ to images. In truth, these filters convert the picture into a different style by using neural style transfer. While it’s highly unlikely that neural style transfer will lead to breakthroughs in different scientific fields, it might lead to some very interesting Snapchat filters in the near future.
